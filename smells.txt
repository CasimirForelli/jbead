Code Smells
-----------

custom define the default colors so that they are exactly
as in dbbead, use named constants instead of directly
allocating the colors, do not use predefined, system
colors.

Now the color (index) is of type byte, thus there are
only 127 colors possible. In practice the limit is 9.
But maybe it would pay to extend this to short or int.
On the other hand, this would double or quadruple the
size of BeadField and the file format would also change.
Not exactly a code smell, but a smelly artificial limit.

The FileMRUClick handler are highly repetitive. Remove
code duplication.

The various mouse event handler have now state checked
in if-else-statements. Better to encapsulate this using
the State pattern.

Analyze whether we need to handle files with absolute
paths. Right now they are relative. Also: is it possible
to change the directory? Is this persisted?

Switch MRU stuff to use File instances instead of Strings.

Make the Point class to a value object, thus immutable.
Right now it is mutable, because the conversion methods
want to return a boolean that signifies if the conversion
succeeded. Refactor this.

Handle the UI state better. For example, the copy/arrange
function should be disabled if no selection exists. This
was handled using the idleHandler before. Now, this should
probably be done using Actions.

The redraw of normal and simulation does not go up to the
upper border. Instead it works til maxj and this gets
corrected, thus there are some lines at the top, that are
not painted.

Model should use Points instead of single coordinates!

Use abstracted tool object for the different tools.
