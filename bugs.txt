B0005

B0003 Undo should also cover author/organization and maybe even description.

B0002 There is a redraw bug in the simulation. It is visible in the hearts
sample file. The partial beads at the left end are not drawn.

B0001 Undo should also undo color changes! Currently this is not part of
the undo snapshot.

Fixed

B0004 If a color x is chosen as the background color, then this color value
is used twice in the color palette. Now, if a pattern is designed and some
beads should be reverted back to the background, if the user accidentally
selects the non-background color x, then the bead list will be strange and
maybe incomprehensible, because the same color signifies two different
states (background and foreground). The solution might be to disallow having
the same color twice in the palette, thus, choosing a color as the background
switches the color with the current background. A mitigation might be to show 
the symbols (not yet implemented) in addition to the color.
