B0008

B0007 When a pattern is shifted, then the editing of the simulation view
does not always work correctly. Have to investigate further for more
details.

B0003 Undo should also cover author/organization and maybe even description.

B0002 There is a redraw bug in the simulation. It is visible in the hearts
sample file. The partial beads at the left end are not drawn.

B0001 Undo should also undo color changes! Currently this is not part of
the undo snapshot.

Fixed

B0006 When a pattern is scrolled and a selection is made, then the arrange
function does not work properly. The wrong part of the pattern is arranged
due to the fact that the scrolled amount is not taken into account.

B0005 Open a saved file with non-standard zoom. Trying to zoom in results
in a zoom out, most probably due to an in correctly applied zoom setting.

B0004 If a color x is chosen as the background color, then this color value
is used twice in the color palette. Now, if a pattern is designed and some
beads should be reverted back to the background, if the user accidentally
selects the non-background color x, then the bead list will be strange and
maybe incomprehensible, because the same color signifies two different
states (background and foreground). The solution might be to disallow having
the same color twice in the palette, thus, choosing a color as the background
switches the color with the current background. A mitigation might be to show 
the symbols (not yet implemented) in addition to the color.
