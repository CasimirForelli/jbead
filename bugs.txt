Bugs

B0003 Undo should also cover author/organization and maybe even description.

B0002 There is a redraw bug in the simulation. It is visible in the hearts
sample file. The partial beads at the left end are not drawn.

B0001 Undo should also undo color changes! Currently this is not part of
the undo snapshot.
