If you cant create the image on a mac because of the build process, here is how you can do it under 
linux:

1. Create a image file, the size is fixed. (dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/eclipse.dmg bs=1M count=130)
2. Get the hfsutils (for redhat or suse: hfsutils-3.2.6-1.i386.rpm from rpmfind.net) and install them.
3. Format the image file: hformat -l Eclipse /root/eclipse.dmg
4. Mount the image: mount -t hfs -o loop /root/eclipse.dmg /mnt/test
5. Copy files into the volume
6. Unmount the volume: umount /mnt/test
7. Thats it.

I have not found out yet how to generate that data for icon location and size of the volume window 
under linux, but, if you dont change that (eg, every eclipse release will have a folder called eclipse, then 
you can specify a background image & icon size in OSX and then copy the .DS_Store file over to the 
linux box and use it for all the future builds.
